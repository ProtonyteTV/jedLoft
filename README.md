## About The Project



jedLoft is a simple iOS application designed for pigeon hobbyists to keep track of their flock. It provides easy-to-use tools for managing pigeon profiles, logging their flight times, and tracking breeding pairs. The app is built to be offline-first, meaning all your data is stored securely and privately right on your device.



## Core Features



jedLoft is packed with features to provide a complete loft management experience:



* **Flock Management**:

* Create detailed profiles for each pigeon, including name, ring ID, breed, color, strain, and a profile photo.

* Track the origin of each bird, whether hatched or bought, and view its current age.



* **Performance Tracking**:

* Log flights with detailed information like location, release time, and arrival time.

* Automatically view calculated performance metrics, including flight duration, average flight time, and a unique Efficiency Score.



* **Advanced Breeding Module**:

* Create and manage breeding pairs with optional names.

* Log individual clutches and track up to two eggs per clutch, including their lay date and status (Laid, Hatched, etc.).

* Receive automatic predictions for egg hatch dates.

* Seamlessly create a new pigeon profile for a hatched bird, with its pedigree pre-filled.



* **Visual Pedigree Charting**:

* View an automatically generated, three-generation visual pedigree chart for any pigeon with known parents. This helps in tracing and understanding the bird's lineage.



* **Robust Data Management**:

* Perform a full backup of all application data (pigeons, flights, breeding pairs) into a single JSON file for safekeeping.

* Import a backup file to easily restore your entire loft's data.



* **Customization & Utilities**:

* Choose between Light, Dark, and System appearance themes.

* Set custom, repeatable daily reminders for important tasks like feeding and training.

* Enable a global "Offline Mode" to disable any feature that uses an internet connection, ensuring maximum privacy.



* **Polished User Experience**:

* A custom animated welcome screen for returning users.

* A guided, multi-step setup process for new users to configure their profile and notification preferences.



## Technology Stack



* **Framework**: SwiftUI

* **Language**: Swift

* **Platform**: iOS 15 and Later

* **Works on**: iPhone and iPod touch

* **Architecture**: MVVM-inspired, using `ObservableObject` managers as the single source of truth.

* **Persistence**: All user data is encoded to JSON and stored locally on the device.

* **UIKit Integration**: Uses `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to bridge specific UIKit components for animations and system features.
